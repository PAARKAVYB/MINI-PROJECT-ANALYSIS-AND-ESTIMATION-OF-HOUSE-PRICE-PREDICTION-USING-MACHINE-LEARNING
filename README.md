## INTRODUCTION
 In past estimating the price of a house or apartment its almost manually
calculated which takes certain amount of time if there is a bulk number of houses.
For the price estimation we will be referring to certain features like no.of. sqft,
bedrooms, living area, amenities etc.…Some of the websites having this information
houses for sale are also mostly not having price estimation option automatically.
Automating the manual calculation with the help of machine learning models which
are concepts of AI quickly and efficiently. Data is the heart of machine learning.
Predictive models use data for training which gives somewhat accurate results.
Without data we can’t train the model. Machine learning involves building these
models from data and uses them to predict new data.
# Statement of the Problem
In the ever-evolving real estate market, the conventional method of manually setting house or apartment prices by owners on platforms like OLX poses significant challenges. This manual approach often results in pricing misalignments, where listed prices may not accurately reflect the true value of the property. To address this issue, the research project focuses on building a forecast model using machine learning algorithms to automate and enhance the accuracy of house price estimations.

1.Automated Precision
2.Data-Driven Insights
3.Transparent Transactions
4.Market Intelligence
5.Technological Advancements

# Proposed Methodology
## Diverse Data Aggregation:
Involves gathering a varied and comprehensive dataset from multiple sources within the real estate domain.
Encompasses diverse factors such as location, size, amenities, and historical pricing data for a holistic understanding.
## Algorithm Application:
Utilizes machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees and possibly ensemble methods, to process the aggregated data.
Applies algorithms to learn patterns and relationships within the data, crucial for accurate house price predictions.
## Rigorous Model Optimization:
Focuses on refining and fine-tuning the machine learning models to enhance their predictive accuracy.
Involves iterative processes of evaluation, adjustment, and optimization to ensure robust and reliable house price predictions.

# Expected results and its Implications
Squared Error, the model ensures reliable predictions, benefiting both buyers and sellers in the real estate market. Buyers gain fair and transparent price estimates, while sellers can strategically price properties for enhanced competitiveness. Industry professionals can leverage the model for precise valuations and strategic insights, advancing real estate analytics. The project's adaptability, with potential extensions for real-time data integration and market trend analysis, ensures relevance in the ever-evolving real estate landscape, providing stakeholders with a valuable tool for navigating property valuation complexities in today's dynamic housing market.

## Data Collection and Data Cleaning
Data collection or data gathering is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system, which then enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes.

The gathered dataset is being cleaned using python and pandas library. The dataset is being read and the null values , duplicate values are removed from the dataset and conversion of the terms is done and a new cleaned data is generated using pandas library and python.
